# 📜 Session History Feature - "See What Others Are Searching"

## 🎉 Feature Overview

A beautiful, modern feature that shows users what others are exploring on Expixi. Users can browse through recent searches and see the full responses with visual guides.

---

## ✨ What Was Built

### 1. **Left Sidebar - Recent Searches**
- Sleek, collapsible sidebar that slides in from the left
- Shows the 50 most recent searches from all users
- Each card shows:
  - User's question
  - Preview of response
  - Number of images generated
  - Time ago (e.g., "2m ago", "5h ago")
  - Location (city, country)
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Glass morphism design

### 2. **Session Viewer Modal**
- Full-screen, beautiful modal to view complete sessions
- **Not a chat interface** - clean presentation format
- Shows:
  - Full question
  - Complete AI response in a card
  - Image carousel with navigation
  - Thumbnail strip for quick image switching
  - Time and location metadata
- Images displayed in a modern, magazine-style layout
- Smooth transitions and animations

### 3. **Auto-Save on Exit**
- Detects when user closes tab or leaves page
- Automatically saves their session to database
- Uses `navigator.sendBeacon` for reliable sending
- Captures:
  - User's last question
  - AI's response
  - All generated images (up to 10)
  - Session duration
  - Message count
  - Location metadata

### 4. **Database Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_query TEXT,
  assistant_response TEXT,
  images JSONB,          -- Stores image array
  needs_images BOOLEAN,
  image_count INTEGER,
  session_duration_ms INTEGER,
  message_count INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  ip_address TEXT,
  country TEXT,
  city TEXT
);
```

### 5. **FIFO Queue (50 Sessions)**
- Automatically keeps only the 50 most recent sessions
- Older sessions automatically deleted
- SQL function: `cleanup_old_sessions()`
- Runs after each new session save

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Created

**Database:**
- `scripts/create-sessions-table.ts` - Creates sessions table

**API Routes:**
- `app/api/sessions/save/route.ts` - Saves sessions
- `app/api/sessions/recent/route.ts` - Fetches 50 recent sessions

**Components:**
- `components/SessionsSidebar.tsx` - Left sidebar with session list
- `components/SessionViewer.tsx` - Modal for viewing sessions

**Integration:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Integrated sidebar, viewer, and auto-save logic
- `components/ChatInterface.tsx` - Added message tracking callback

## 🚀 How It Works

### Flow Diagram:

```
User asks question → Gets response → Closes tab
                                        ↓
                              beforeunload event fires
                                        ↓
                           navigator.sendBeacon saves session
                                        ↓
                            Session added to database
                                        ↓
                        FIFO cleanup (keep only 50)
                                        ↓
                        Sidebar refreshes for all users
                                        ↓
                   Other users see the new session
```

### Save Logic:

```typescript
// On page unload
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
  if (hasChat) {
    const data = {
      userQuery: lastQuestion,
      assistantResponse: lastAnswer,
      images: generatedImages.slice(0, 10),
      sessionDuration: Date.now() - startTime,
      messageCount: totalMessages,
    };
    navigator.sendBeacon('/api/sessions/save', JSON.stringify(data));
  }
});
```

### Fetch Logic:

```typescript
// Every 30 seconds
setInterval(async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/sessions/recent');
  const data = await response.json();
  setSessions(data.sessions); // Update sidebar
}, 30000);
```

## 📊 Database Queries

### Save Session:
```sql
INSERT INTO sessions (
  user_query, assistant_response, images,
  needs_images, image_count, session_duration_ms,
  message_count, ip_address, country, city
) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10);

SELECT cleanup_old_sessions(); -- FIFO cleanup
```

### Get Recent Sessions:
```sql
SELECT id, user_query, assistant_response, images,
       needs_images, image_count, message_count,
       created_at, country, city
FROM sessions
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Auto-Cleanup (FIFO):
```sql
DELETE FROM sessions 
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM sessions 
  ORDER BY created_at DESC 
  OFFSET 50
);
```
