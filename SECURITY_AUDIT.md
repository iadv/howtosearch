# 🔒 Security Audit Report

## Date: October 15, 2025

## ✅ Security Issues Fixed

### 1. **API Key Leak in Git History** ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** 
- Gemini API key `AIzaSyDKBSvYhHmmEDrZlaH5M6cOBfocgZpdJ_E` was hardcoded in `CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- Committed to git repository in initial commit
- Pushed to public GitHub repository at https://github.com/iadv/howtosearch

**Severity:** CRITICAL ⚠️

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Removed API key from `CURRENT_STATUS.md` in working directory
2. ✅ Rewrote entire git history using `git filter-branch` to replace API key with placeholder
3. ✅ Force-pushed cleaned history to GitHub
4. ✅ Removed all git backup refs and garbage collected

**Impact:** 
- API key was publicly visible on GitHub
- Anyone could have accessed and used the API key
- Potential unauthorized usage and charges

**Required Action:** 
🚨 **IMMEDIATELY REGENERATE YOUR GEMINI API KEY** 🚨

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Delete the compromised key: `AIzaSyDKBSvYhHmmEDrZlaH5M6cOBfocgZpdJ_E`
3. Create a new API key
4. Update `.env.local` with new key:
   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_new_key_here
   ```
5. Restart your development server

## ✅ Security Best Practices Verified

### Environment Variables ✅
- `.env.local` file exists and is NOT tracked by git
- `.gitignore` properly excludes `.env` and `.env*.local` files
- All API keys loaded from environment variables, not hardcoded

### Code Security ✅
- No hardcoded API keys in TypeScript/JavaScript files
- All API keys accessed via `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`
- API keys only used in server-side code (API routes)

### Git Security ✅
- No `.env` files in git history
- No database credentials in git history
- All sensitive files properly gitignored

---

## 📋 Files Checked

### Clean Files (No Issues)
- ✅ `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Uses `process.env.CLAUDE_API_KEY`
- ✅ `app/api/generate-images/route.ts` - Uses `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`
- ✅ `lib/db.ts` - Uses `process.env.DATABASE_URL`
- ✅ `lib/request-logger.ts` - No sensitive data
- ✅ `lib/safety-filter.ts` - No sensitive data
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Properly configured
- ✅ `.env.local` - NOT tracked by git (correct)

### Fixed Files
- ⚠️ `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Removed hardcoded API key, replaced with placeholder

### Documentation Files (Safe Placeholders)
- ✅ `README.md` - Only placeholder examples
- ✅ `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Only truncated examples
- ✅ `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Only truncated examples
- ✅ `USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Only truncated examples
- ✅ `QUICK_START.md` - Only truncated examples

---

## 🔐 Current Security Status

### Secrets Management ✅
- All API keys in `.env.local`
- Environment file properly gitignored
- No secrets in source code

### Git Repository ✅
- History cleaned of all API keys
- No sensitive credentials tracked
- Force-pushed to remote

### Database ✅
- Connection string in environment variables
- No credentials hardcoded
- NeonDB uses secure connections

### API Security ✅
- API keys used only in Edge runtime
- No client-side exposure
- Proper error handling without leaking keys

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate (DO NOW)
1. **Regenerate Gemini API key** - The exposed key must be deleted
2. **Monitor API usage** - Check Google Cloud Console for any unauthorized usage
3. **Review billing** - Ensure no unexpected charges

### Best Practices Going Forward
1. **Never commit `.env` files** - Already configured ✅
2. **Use secrets management** - Consider Vercel Environment Variables for production
3. **Regular audits** - Scan codebase for leaked secrets
4. **API key rotation** - Rotate keys periodically
5. **Restrict API keys** - Use API restrictions (IP allowlists, HTTP referrer restrictions)

### Tools to Consider
- **git-secrets**: Prevents committing secrets
- **truffleHog**: Scans git history for secrets
- **GitHub secret scanning**: Automatically detects leaked secrets

## 📊 Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| API Keys in Code | ✅ Clean | All use environment variables |
| API Keys in Git History | ✅ Fixed | History rewritten and force-pushed |
| Environment Files | ✅ Secure | Properly gitignored |
| Database Credentials | ✅ Secure | In environment variables only |
| Documentation | ✅ Safe | Only placeholder examples |

---

## 🚨 Critical Next Step

**YOU MUST REGENERATE YOUR GEMINI API KEY IMMEDIATELY**

The exposed API key was publicly visible on GitHub. Even though we've removed it from the repository, it may have been:
- Indexed by GitHub
- Cached by search engines
- Scraped by bots
- Downloaded by users

**The ONLY way to secure your account is to DELETE the old key and create a new one.**

## ✅ Verification Commands

Run these to verify security:

```bash
# Verify no API keys in git history
git log -p | grep -i "AIzaSy" || echo "✅ Clean"

# Verify .env not tracked
git ls-files | grep ".env" || echo "✅ Clean"

# Verify no hardcoded secrets in code
grep -r "sk-ant-api" app/ lib/ || echo "✅ Clean"
grep -r "AIza[A-Za-z0-9_-]{35}" app/ lib/ || echo "✅ Clean"
```
